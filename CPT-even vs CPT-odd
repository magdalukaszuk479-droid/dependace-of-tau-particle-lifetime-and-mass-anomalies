Lorentz's Law: τlab​=τ0​γ(1+δ(γ,p​,n^))
cpt
c-charge - exchange of particles for antiparticles
p-parity - spatial reflection
t-time - time reversal
Simulation Results:
Simulation 1:
CPT-even: mean delta = 8.073e-17 s, max delta = 2.903e-16 s
CPT-odd: mean delta = 5.376e-18 s, max delta = 1.451e-17 s
In a typical Standard Model, both numbers should be 0, but they are expected from the Standard Model (ME), which allows for violation of the Lorentz rule.

The graph demonstrates that the effects of Lorentz violation are energy-dependent.
