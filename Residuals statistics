The a LV data indicate a linear anomaly. In a co SR universe, it would work perfectly with Einstein's assumptions, so it would be 0.
The b QG data indicate a quadratic anomaly. In a co SR universe, it would work perfectly with Einstein's assumptions, so it would be 0, just like the other data.

To check if the MEAN was correct, I calculated the following in Python:

SEM = (std) / √N
SEM = Standard Error of the Mean
std - standard deviation (a measure of error distribution)
N - number of data points
After calculating in Python, the following was maintained:

Number of data points (N): 10,000
Standard Deviation (std): 0.02
Standard Error of the Mean (SEM): 0.0002
The SEM result means that the data are precise enough to be considered.
The result: mean = 1.429e-06. The mean residual value indicates that the model is unbiased, meaning there is no noise, meaning there is no overestimation or underestimation.

Residual - a measure of how much the experimental data deviate from the theoretical model:
